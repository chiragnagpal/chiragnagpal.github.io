I've worked on Arduino and MSP430 Platforms and now I'm exploring Embedded Linux on the BeagleBone Black.\r\n\r\nI plan to use GitHub to easily collaborate on my College projects and assignments, and seek or provide (mostly the former) help to the world whenever required or available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
