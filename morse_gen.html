        <h1>Morse Code Generator on MSP430</h1>
<hr>	
<br>
<p>Having completed my freshman year at college, I decided to apply my knowledge 'hands-on' on some live project. At the same time I also heard about a month long workshop on the MSP430 at TI Center of Excellence at <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/" >NSIT, Delhi</a> under <a href="http://www.dvgadre.com/">Prof. DV Gadre</a>.</p>
<p>The program was to consist of 3 modules, the first week with PCB design in CADSOFT Eagle, the next phase was the basics of MSP430 and programming in C and the last consisted of a individual project. Sweet! I decided to apply for the program, and luckily was selected.!</p>
<p>During my sessions there, I got an opportunity to interact with Prof Gadre on Amateur Radio, he motivated me to apply for one, it is then that I decided to develop a Morse Code Generator on the MSP430. </p>
<p>For the project, I decided to interface a legacy PS/2 keyboard to the MSP430 to enter the text for which morse was to be generated. I also planned to put a 16x2 LCD to display the text. The morse was to be output on a piezo buzzer, instead of a speaker, allowing me to save a PWM pin.</p>
<p>The problem of using a PS/2 keyboard was 
<ul>
<li>Level Conversion from 5V(Keyboard) to 3.3V(MSP430)<br>
<ld>For level conversion, first I decided to use BJTs, however in the final schematic, I used the CD 4050 Buffer IC, thus simplifying the conversion.
<li>Implementing 2-way communication<br>
<ld>The PS/2 is bi-directional, allowing the controller to send data to the keyboard, this is basically to toggle the LEDs on the keyboard. 
For my project, I did not require those indicators, and so decided to ignore this aspect, and implement a simple one way communication.
</ul>

</p>
<p>So now that the basic design was considered, I went ahead with the schematic, this is what it looks like:<br>

<p>Now was the board layout, this being my first board layout of this scale, Prof Gadre, personally helped me routing the board. Check it out, cool eh!<br><br>
<img src="morsebrd.png" width=100%>
<p>The board was then etched on a copper clad board, using ferric chloride. Various components were soldered on the Board, and this was the result:<br><br>
<img src="morsefinal.jpg" width=100%>
</p>
<p>So it was now coding time! I used the MSP430 Launchpad as a programmer, this proved to be painful, as I had to remove the MSP430 many times and replace it in the launchpad to program. It's only after the board was etched and soldered that I learned about the spy-by-wire.
I wish I had implemented this on my board, would have saved me from  lot of trouble.
</p>
<p>To implement PS/2, I attached an interrupt on the Clk pin of the PS/2. The ISR serving this was programmed in a way to detect the 11bit sequence on the Data line using a timing delay. The amount of delay cycles required was calculated by me by probing the clk line on the oscilloscope.
</p>
<p>
Next was the LCD, this was a tough nut to crack. All the standard libraries around on the net, for the MSP430 were for schematics wherein the LCD pins were connected to the MSP pins in a sequential manner. However in my design the pins were connected in a 'reverse' order. I tired porting libraries but in vain. I then decided to brute force and code the interface from scratch. After going through the HD44780 datasheet, I spent a night coding the interface and finally managed to initiate the LCD in '4-bit mode'. 
</p>
<p>I then moved on to code Morse Code for each and every character, and with that the project was complete. Take a look at the video of the project live:
