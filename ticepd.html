        <h1>Summer at TI Centre for Embedded Product Design !!!</h1>
<hr>	
<br>
<p>During my first year at college, I had being playing around with bread boards and Arduinos. However, as a Computer Engineering student, I faced opposition from my batchmates and seniors on my field of interest as it was considered to be inclined more towards electronics and hardware. However, I was determined to explore the field of embedded systems further, and a wonderful opportunity came to me in the form of the Summer Internship Workshop at the Texas Instruments Centre for Embedded Product Design(TI-CEPD), Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology(NSIT), Delhi. 
 <br>
<p>I attended the internship programme at the TI-CEPD at the end of my first year, while opting for the MSP430 track. The training was an extremely enriching and one of a kind experience. I got exposed to a whole lot more than just learning about microcontrollers and PCB design. Prof. Gadre and his team of student mentors were extremely warm with all the participants.  
 <br>
<p>The first week was invested in learning EAGLE, one of the most widely adopted tools for PCB design. This was the first time when I got a chance to design those cool, geeky looking PCBs which had fascinated me. 
<br> 
<p>Getting hands dirty while making our own circuits boards from bottoms up was a really exciting experience! 
My first PCB was an electronic Eye-Loupe, that used a Joule-Thief circuit to run an array of LEDs, just off a single, dying AA battery! Cool, eh? 
<br> 
<p>Prof. Gadre's lectures were extremely refreshing, and were not limited to the MSP430 or even embedded systems. Infact, Prof. Gadre talked about topics ranging from core analog electronics to wireless communication, modulation techniques to hot computer science topics like the Internet of Things! It was thrilling indeed to see him sway so artistically from such involved technologies, to talk about basic architecture concepts like Round Robbin Scheduling, that too from a completely practical perspective! For a student just out of first year, getting to learn these basics, and that too put so simply and convincingly, was truly a boon that helped me sail through my semesters. 
 <br>
<p>In one of these lectures, I talked to Prof. Gadre about HAM or Amateur Radio. Prof. Gadre promptly showed me one of his first projects, a 8051 based morse code tutor for HAM radio enthusiasts. I decided to emulate the same project, with a PS/2 keyboard, a piezo buzzer a 16x2 LED with the MSP430 at heart. 
 <br>
<p>By the third week, I had started implementing my project. Routing the board was the first tough nut to crack, luckily Prof. Gadre helped me route my board. MSP430 uses Embedded C, although I was quite comfortable with C, handling C with microcontrollers, was a whole new challenge.  
 <br>
<p>Next came the keyboard, PS/2 was an extremely well documented protocol, so I developed an interrupt driven code to, that called a function to decode the ASCII sequence whenever a key  was pressed on the board. Then the LCD: that took a lot of hard work!! I spent a couple of nights trying to code it! With some help from the extremely sharp senior participant of the workshop, Nikhilesh, I managed to initialise my LCD. In the middle of the night, finally, the first block of my LCD lit up with an 'H'. Oh Boy! I was excited! I quickly messaged Prof. Gadre, and he too, in the middle of the night was equally excited and replied back asking me to try to print 'Hello TICEPD'.  
Within the next half an hour, I coded it to do that and sent Prof. Gadre a screenshot! And what do I see! My project was Prof. Gadre's cover pic :D! 
 <br>
<p>I was officially the first participant to finish my project and the next winter, I returned to the lab as a student mentor for the MSP430 track. I have been visiting TI CEPD since then. Some of my work has been featured in blogs like Hack A Day and I have also received my HAM License, all thanks to the initial exposure I received at TI CEPD. 
 <br>
<p>The best part about TI CEPD is that it is truly inter disciplinary in nature, and everyone, be it from Electronics, Computer Science, or any other background, can find something interesting to work on. TI CEPD is truly an Engineersâ€™ paradise, from Drill Machines, to Solder Irons, Shop Bot, to a 3D printer: name it and you'll find it there!
